I have cut this and found that the Z axis needs 3 steppers which can be driven by the same stepper driver.

Also the build platform needs 2 more solid rods in the front. 



Changes to be done

move the electronics to the back the cable gets in the way

add lcd and encoder 

add 1 more z axis stepper in the front

make slot for the sd card in the side close to the electronics 

reinforce the build platform solid rods mount and make the floating one fixed like the right side
